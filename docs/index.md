    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a senior software engineer developing in Ruby on Rails. I'm working as a contractor with the US GSA on Login.gov on its identity platform application. It is highly satisfying to have the opportunity to build knowledge in this codebase and coding framework.</p><p>This career has been enjoyable particularly because there is a seemingly limitless number of different things to learn. It's really fun getting into a project and knowing that I'll come out on the other side with some interesting new skill or technique. I am fortunate to have worked with so many smart people. There's so much to pick up and I treasure the experience. It is exceedingly gratifying when I have the opportunity to share what I have learned with my colleagues.</p>
